        <h2 id="headline">The story of saving people</h2>
        <p class="story">On September 16, 1976, Shavarsh Karapetyan, his brother and a friend were going for a morning jog. By chance they found themselves at the site of a trolleybus crash into the Yerevan reservoir. Karapetyan began to rescue people from the water. He passed drowning people to his brother, and his brother transferred them to the boat, and from the boat to the car. At a depth of 10 meters with zero visibility, Shavarsh broke the rear window of the trolleybus with his feet and pulled out 46 passengers out of 92. 20 of them were brought back to life. The unconscious passengers were taken to the hospital. During one of his deep dives, Shavarsh realized that he had pulled out not a person, but a cushion from a trolleybus seat. According to him, he often dreamed about this pillow at night, as he could save another life.</p>
